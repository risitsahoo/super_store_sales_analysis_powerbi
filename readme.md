## ❗ Business Problem Statement

Retail organizations generate large volumes of sales data on a daily basis. Without structured analysis, decision-makers face challenges in:

- Monitoring overall sales and profitability  
- Identifying high-performing and underperforming regions  
- Analysing category-wise and customer-level performance  
- Supporting data-driven strategic decisions  

This project addresses these challenges by delivering a centralized, interactive Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to track performance and identify improvement opportunities efficiently.
